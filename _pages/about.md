I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Bergner Astrochemistry group at the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the Widicus Weaver group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include planet formation, radiative transfer modeling, and ice chemistry.
