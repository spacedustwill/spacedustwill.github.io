I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Chemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley. My research aims to answer big questions in the chemistry of space and the origin(s) of life, such as: 

- How do planets form? 
- Can the chemistry during planet formation plant the initial seeds of life? 

To help answer these questions, I use numerical simulations and high-performance computing to study the chemical and physical environments in which planets form: protoplanetary disks. 


Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, my research combined radio interferometry of star-forming regions and laboratory experiments of astrophysical ice analogs to understand the chemical complexity of star formation.
