I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Chemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley. My research aims to answer big questions in the chemistry of space and the origin(s) of life, such as: 

- How do planets form? 
- Can the chemistry during planet formation plant the initial seeds of life? 

To help answer these questions, I use numerical simulations and high-performance computing to study the chemical and physical environments in which planets form: protoplanetary disks. I am also broadly interested in scientific computing, data analysis techniques, and data visualization. 


Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, my research combined radio interferometry of star-forming regions and laboratory experiments of astrophysical ice analogs to understand the chemical complexity of star formation. 

## Life Outside of Work

When not at work, I spend the majority of my time rock climbing, mountain biking, or exploring nature in other ways. To see some of my select adventures, check out my blog!
